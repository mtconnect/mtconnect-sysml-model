# mtconnect-sysml-model
This project is the work-in-progess SysML model for the MTConnect standard.

MTConnect is a well-established semantic vocabulary for factory equipment. The information model for MTConnect is being documented in SysML to allow easier portability, faster deployment, and better integration and interoperability with other standards and protocols.

# What's Included

The model is available in four formats:
1. Enterprise Architect (EA) model
2. XMI
3. HTML (only IE compatible)
4. PDF

# What's Not Included

Not all dataitem types have been added, only examples so far. 

A complete glossary of MTConnect terms underlying the model will be referenced or included here when it is complete. All dataitems and terms are available now in the normative MTConnect standard (PDF only).

# Getting Started

Users should be familiar with MTConnect version 1.5 by browsing the complete MTConnect standard or by referring back to the standard while exploring the SysML model/XMI.
